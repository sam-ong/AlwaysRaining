# TwoDoggies

This is a simple, fun project that allows me to learn .NET, C#, and experiment with SMAPI and game modification.

I originally wanted to create a mod for Stardew Valley that would increase the amount of dogs you can own to two, hence the name. It's kinda changed since then.

[Here](https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)'s a bunch of ideas for Stardew Valley mods that I'll pick from.
